<p><strong>WoundMap</strong> promotes best practices in wound care through standardized documentation processes supported by wound photos with the convenience of a mobile platform. Wound progress is easily tracked by reviewing photos and graphs of wound measurements. The result - improved care and reduced cost.</p>
<p><strong>WoundMap</strong> guides the clinician through the process of gathering patient information, characterizing wounds, completing risk assessments, acquiring photos paired with a wound assessment and treatment, and crafting a care plan.</p>
<p>It is helpful to understand how WoundMap organizes patient information.</p>
<p>First, you can manage any number of <strong>Patients</strong>. Just tap 'Add Patient' and complete as much patient information as required. To switch to another patient, tap 'Select Patient'. To edit the currently selected patient, tap 'Edit Patient'.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, you will find these buttons behind the patient name panel at the top of the screen. Just swipe right to access the buttons.</p>
<p>Second, each patient may have one or more <strong>Wounds</strong>. You are required to add or select a wound before gathering wound information or taking a photo. To add a wound, tap 'Add Wound'. To select a wound, tap 'Select Wound'. To edit the selected wound, tap 'Edit Wound'.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, you will find these buttons behind the patient name panel at the top of the screen. Just swipe right to access the buttons.</p>
<p>Third, each wound may have one or more <strong>Photos</strong>. Each wound photo may be associated with a <strong>Wound Assessment</strong>. The photos of each wound can be reviewed by tapping the 'Browse Photos' button in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Graphs of measurements and other quantitative data can be viewed by tapping on the 'View Graphs' button in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Forth, a <strong>Policy</strong> is used to suggest the timing and order of tasks to perform for each patient and wound. For example, the policy may recommend that a Skin Assessment be completed every day. Policies may differ for each <strong>Clinical Setting</strong>, such as Outpatient or Skilled Nursing. Policies may also differ for each <strong>Stage</strong> of care - Initial workup, Follow-up, and Discharge. The policy editor can be accessed by tapping the button at top left of the home screen.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, the Clinical Setting and Stage of Care controls will scroll up behind the patient name/wound name panel after a short delay. Pull down on the compass interface to expose these controls.</p>
<p>Always be sure to select the intended patient and wound before gathering information or taking photos.</p>
