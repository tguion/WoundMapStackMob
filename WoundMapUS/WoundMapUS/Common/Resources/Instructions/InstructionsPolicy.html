<p><strong>Policies</strong> suggest the order and timing of tasks to be performed for a patient and wound. A policy will also limit the amount of time that data can be changed once it is entered. The policies establish the clinical standards for wound care, specific to the level of care of the patient.</p>
<p>Policies may differ for each <strong>Clinical Setting</strong> and for each <strong>Stage of Care</strong>.</p>
<p>The policy for the selected clinical setting and stage of care are presented in the compass interface. The compass will point to the next task to be addressed. Status symbols shown with the task button indicate the compliance level of the task.</p>
<p>View and edit policies by tapping on the gear button top left of the home screen. The Policy Editor will allow you to modify the frequency and open-time for the tasks. Tap 'Edit' to reorder the tasks.</p>
<p>When you are done editing a policy, the application will ask if you want to apply the policy to the current patient. If you answer yes, the policy will be copied into the current patient record and applied to the compass map interface. If you answer no, the policy will be applied to patients added in the future.</p>
