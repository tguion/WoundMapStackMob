<p>Patient information needs to be secure. WoundMap allows a <strong>Pin Code</strong> to restrict access the the application and the data. An alternative to using a Pin Code is to take advantage of iOS security features.</p>
<p><strong>Pin Code</strong></p>
<p>A Pin Code can be entered when the application is first used. If you choose to use a Pin Code, the same Pin Code will be used for all users and all devices with the same Apple ID. Be sure to remember the Pin Code, and communicate the Pin Code with others who will use the device.</p>
<p><strong>iOS Security Features</strong></p>
<p>As an alternative to the WoundMap Pin Code, you can elect to use iOS security features. The most obvious iOS security feature is the iOS Pin Code that provides access to the device. Other security features are detailed in <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/security.html'>Apple's web site</a> at http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/security.html.</p>
<p>Note that you may elect to not enter the patient's name when adding a new patient. Use the <strong>EMR/Record Identifier</strong> to identify the patient.</p>
