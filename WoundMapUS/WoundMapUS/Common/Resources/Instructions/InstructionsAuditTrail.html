<p>Users are required to create a user name when starting WoundMap. Once an account has been created, the user identifies themselves using their account name. Any number of users can create accounts, but all users must know and use the same Pin Code if the Pin Code feature is enabled.<p>
<p>By requiring users to identify themselves, WoundMap can track who is making changes to patient and wound data. The views that provide data input will provide a button in the right side of the tool bar at the bottom of the screen. Tap the button to see an audit trail of data changes.</p>
