<p>To get the best value from wound photos, it is important to take each photo with the same perspective and with a physical ruler in the field of view. WoundMap has a number of features to help you accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a Photo</strong></p>
<p>After the first photo of a wound has been recorded, tap the center of the screen while taking the new photo to see a superimposed image of the previous photo. This will allow you to duplicate the perspective for the new photo.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming a Photo</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, during the measurement sequence, the previous photo is shown under the current photo. Use standard gestures to translate, scale, and rotate the new photo to better match the perspective of the previous photo.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Scale</strong></p>
<p>The scale of the photo needs to be established to obtain the wound dimensions. One step in the measurement sequence shows a white virtual ruler superimposed on the photo. Use standard gestures - drag, pinch, rotate - to match the white virtual ruler with the physical ruler in the photo. Double tap on the physical ruler to magnify the portion of the photo containing the physical ruler if needed. When the virtual ruler tic marks are aligned with the physical ruler, tap Save.</p>
<p><strong>Measure Length and Width</strong></p>
<p>Once the scale of the photo has been established, you can measure the width and length of the wound. Use standard gestures to translate and rotate the measurement tabs to match the orientation of the wound. Drag the gray tabs to match the width and length of the wound. Rotation gestures can be used to adjust the measurement to the best angle. Also, the user can  move the entire red grid by dragging from the center of the red measurement lines.  When the grid is aligned tap Save.</p>
<p><strong>Depth</strong></p>
<p>The next step in the measurement sequence allows you to enter the depth of the wound.</p>
<p><strong>Undermining &amp; Tunneling</strong></p>
<p>The next step in the measurement sequence allows you to enter the Undermining &amp; Tunneling present in the wound. Tap the Add buttons to add as many entries as needed.</p>
<p>After completing the measurement sequence, the Policy may suggest that additional information be added to the wound photo using the <strong>Wound Assessment</strong> feature.</p>
