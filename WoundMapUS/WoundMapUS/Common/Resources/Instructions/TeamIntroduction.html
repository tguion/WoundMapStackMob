<p>WoundMap Team allows new users to use WoundMap for free by deferring team option. But most clinicians work as a team of wound care clinicians and administrators. When you need to collaborate in patient care, select one member of your team to be the team leader, who will create a team and invite each member of the team to join the team.<p>
<p>The Team option requires an In-App purchase for each member of the team. The team leader is responsible for the monthly subscription fee for each team member.</p>
<p>Tap 'Create Team' after signing into WoundMap. You will be required to purchase a monthly subscription as the team leader. Once the team leader has completed the In-App purchase, other members of the clinical team can be invited to join the team. The team leader will need to ask others for their WoundMap user name. Then, from the Team Management view, tap 'Invite a Participant', enter the participant's WoundMap user name, and enter a pin code for extra security. The team leader then communicates the pin code to the invited participant. When the invited participant signs in again, they will see that they have a pending invitation to join the team. The invited participant should top on the invitation, and enter the pin code.</p>
<p>The invited participant should notify the team leader that they have accepted the invitation. The team leader should then navigate to the team management view, and confirm the invitation. This sequence of steps is required because the patient data is vigorously restricted to the creator of the patient chart or to other members of the team. The team invitation sequence ensures that the intended participant is joining the team, because once the invitation is confirmed, patient data collected by the invited participant and all team patient data are now visible to all team members.</p>
