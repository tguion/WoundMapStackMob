<p>WoundMap Team</p>
<p>A WoundMap Team allows any number of participants (users or team members) to collaborate in patient wound health care. All patient data collected by a team member will be available to other team members in real time no matter where in the world the patient is located.</p>
<p>Once a team is created, you will be the team member, and each new team member that you add to the team will result in a monthly subscription fee of |$99| per month.</p>
<p>You add a new team member (invitee) by creating an invitation using the WoundMap Team invitee's' user name. Once the invitee accepts the invitation, you confirm the invitation to complete the transaction</p>
