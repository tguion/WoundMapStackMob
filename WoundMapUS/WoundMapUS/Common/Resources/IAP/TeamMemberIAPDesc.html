<p><strong>WoundMap Team</strong></p>
<p>A WoundMap Team allows any number of participants (users or team members) to collaborate in patient wound health care. All patient data collected by a team member will be available to other team members in real time no matter where in the world the patient or participant is located.</p>
<p>Once you have created a team, patient data will be available on any device that has WoundMap installed.</p>
<p>Once a team is created, you will be the team leader, and your account will be charged a monthly subscription fee of |$99|.</p>
<p>Each team member that you add to the team will result in an additional monthly subscription fee of |$99| per month for each team member.</p>
<p>You add a new team member (invitee) by creating an invitation using the WoundMap Team invitee's user name. Once the invitee accepts the invitation, you confirm the invitation to complete the transaction, and the monthly subscription charges will go into effect.</p>
