	<key>Normal Saline</key>
	<string>A sterile solution of sodium chloride that is isotonic to body fluids, used to maintain living tissue temporarily and as a solvent for parenterally administered drugs. (7)</string>
	<key>Sterile Water</key>
	<string>Water for injection that is sterilized and contains no antimicrobial agents or other added substances. It is used for irrigation but not for parenteral administration. (7)</string>
	<key>Soap and Water</key>
	<string>The use of soap and water together for ceansing purposes</string>
	<key>Tap Water/Shower</key>
	<string>To use water from the spigot for bathing purposes</string>

	<string>Manfactured cleaner for use on the patient durring bathing</string>
	<key>Whirlpool</key>
	<string>Local or general hot water application characterized by forceful jets of air through the water. Used most commonly in rehabilitation to stimulate circulation and provide pain relief.  (7)</string>
	<key>Primary Dressing</key>
	<string>The dressing that is closest to the wound.</string>
	<key>Skin Prep Barrier</key>
	<string>A topical product applied to the skin to create a barrier to moisture, dryness, or other non-favorable exposure</string>
	<key>Hydrogel</key>
	<string>Polymers, water- or glycerin-based amorphous gels, impregnanted gauzes, or sheet dressings.  They do not absorb large amounts of exudate because of their high water content.  They help maintain a moist wound environment and promote granulation and epithelialization.  They generally require a secondary dressing.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Calcium Alginate</key>
	<string>Alginates are composed of natural polysaccharide fibers or are derived from seaweed.  They are composed of soft, nonwoven fibers shaped as a rope or pads.  Alginates are highly absorbent and conform to the shape of the wound.  When placed into a wound, an alginate generally interacts with wound exudate to form a gel that maintains a moist healing environment.  There must be enough exudate in the wound to convert the dry alginate fibers into a gel.  They can require a secondary dressing.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Foam</key>
	<string>Nonlinting and absorbent; create a moist environment and provide thermal insulation to the wound.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Fistula management Device</key>
	<string>A physical object used to repair or control a fistula</string>
	<key>Hydrocolloids</key>
	<string>Occlusive or semiocclusive dressings composed of materials such as gelatin, pectin, and/or carboxymethylcellulose that provide a moist healing environment that allows clean wounds to granulate and necrotic wounds to debride autolytically.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Collagen</key>
	<string>The main supportive protein of cartilage, connective tissue, tendon, skin, and bone. (7)</string>
	<key>Composite Dressing</key>
	<string>Composite dressings are wound covers that combine physically distinct components into a single product to provide multiple functions, such as a bacterial barrier, absorption and adhesion. Usually, they are comprised of multiple layers and incorporate a semi- or non-adherent pad that covers the wound. May also include an adhesive border of non-woven fabric tape or transparent film. They can function as either a primary or a secondary dressing on a wide variety of wounds and may be used with topical medications. (8)</string>
	<key>Non-adherent Dressing</key>
	<string>A dressing designed specifically not to stick to the dried secretions of a wound. (7)</string>
	<key>Packing Strips</key>
	<string>non-medicated - most likely gauze</string>
	<key>Film</key>
	<string>Adhesive, semipermeable, polyurethane membrane dressings are waterproof and impermeable to contaminants and bacteria.  They permit water vapor and atmospheric gases to cross the barrier.  They do not absorb drainage.  They retain mosture and are to be changed when fluid accumulates beneath them.  Because they are clear, wounds can be assessed without removing the dressing.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Silver Dressing</key>
	<string>wound dressings incorporating silver (1 part per million); used to treat meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected ulcers (7)</string>
	<key>Powder</key>
	<string>A homogeneous dispersion of finely divided, relatively dry particulate matter consisting of one or more substances. (7)</string>
	<key>Honey Dressing</key>
	<string>A dressing treated with honey (Active Leptospermum)</string>
	<key>Honey Liquid</key>
	<string>A liquid honey (Active Leptospermum) used for wound treatment</string>
	<key>NPWT(Negative Pressure Wound Treatment)</key>
	<string>This is a system that uses controlled negative pressure (vacuum) to help promote wound healing.  The system consists of a computer-controlled therapy unit, canister, sterile plastic tube, foam dressing, and clear V.A.C. drape.  The foam dressing goes inside the wound.  One end of the tube connects to the foam.  The other end of the tube connects to the cannister, which, in turn, connects to the V.A.C.  The VAC system pulls infectious materials and excess interstitial fluid from the wound through the tube and collects them inside the canister.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
	<key>Secondary Dressing</key>
	<string>The dressing that is secondary to the wound, after the primary dressing.</string>
	<key>ABD</key>
	<string>Absorptive gauze pad</string>
	<key>Absorptive</key>
	<string>Absorbent</string>
	<key>Tape</key>
	<string>Strips of material, usually with adhesive, used to secure bandages. (7)</string>
	<key>Compression Wrap</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>Compression Hose</key>
	<string>Use of circumferential elastic tubing to apply pressure as a treatment of conditions such as burns, lymphedema, edema and venous stasis, and formation of scar tissue.   Reference:  Stedman&apos;s Medical Dictionary</string>
	<key>Gauze/Kerlix</key>
	<string>Kerlix brand of gauze and sponges</string>
	<key>Chair Cushion</key>
	<string>A supplemental cushion used for sitting on in a chair</string>

	<key>Moisture Cream</key>
	<string>A topical cream used to improve the skin&apos;s moisture</string>
	<key>Nutritional Support</key>
	<string>A focus in wound treatment that factors the impact of nutrition on the status of the wound and ongoing treatment</string>
