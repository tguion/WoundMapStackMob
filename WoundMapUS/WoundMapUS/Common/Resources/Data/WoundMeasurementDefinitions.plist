	<key>Tubular Bandage</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>VAC (Negative Pressure Device)</key>
	<string>This is a system that uses controlled negative pressure (vacuum) to help promote wound healing.  The system consists of a computer-controlled therapy unit, canister, sterile plastic tube, foam dressing, and clear V.A.C. drape.  The foam dressing goes inside the wound.  One end of the tube connects to the foam.  The other end of the tube connects to the cannister, which, in turn, connects to the V.A.C.  The VAC system pulls infectious materials and excess interstitial fluid from the wound through the tube and collects them inside the canister.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009</string>
