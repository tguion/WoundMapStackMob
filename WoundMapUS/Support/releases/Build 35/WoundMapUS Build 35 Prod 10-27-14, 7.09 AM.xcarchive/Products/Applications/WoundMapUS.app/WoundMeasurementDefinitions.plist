Color, induration, warmth and edema should be assessed.  Redness of the surrounding skin can be indicative of unrelieved prssure.  Irritation of the surrounding skin can result from exposure to feces or urine, a reaction to the dressing or tape, or inappropriate removal of dressing or tape.  Redness, tenderness, warmth and swelling are classical clinical signs of infection.

Appearance of the lesions varies with the type of purpura, the duration of the lesions, and the acuteness of onset.  The color is first red, gradually darkens to purple, fades to a brownish yellow, and usually disappears in 2-3 weeks.  Reference:  Stedman's Medical Dictionary_'No dressing on the wound - open to air._Alginates are composed of natural polysaccharide fibers or are derived from seaweed.  They are composed of soft, nonwoven fibers shaped as a rope or pads.  Alginates are highly absorbent and conform to the shape of the wound.  When placed into a wound, an alginate generally interacts with wound exudate to form a gel that maintains a moist healing environment.  There must be enough exudate in the wound to convert the dry alginate fibers into a gel.  They can require a secondary dressing.

Reference:  Stedman's Medical Dictionary_AThis is a system that uses controlled negative pressure (vacuum) to help promote wound healing.  The system consists of a computer-controlled therapy unit, canister, sterile plastic tube, foam dressing, and clear V.A.C. drape.  The foam dressing goes inside the wound.  One end of the tube connects to the foam.  The other end of the tube connects to the cannister, which, in turn, connects to the V.A.C.  The VAC system pulls infectious materials and excess interstitial fluid from the wound through the tube and collects them inside the canister.

They are comfortable and absorbent, and they interact with wound exudate to form a gel.  Reference:  Brown, P., 2009_”Adhesive, semipermeable, polyurethane membrane dressings are waterproof and impermeable to contaminants and bacteria.  They permit water vapor and atmospheric gases to cross the barrier.  They do not absorb drainage.  They retain mosture and are to be changed when fluid accumulates beneath them.  Because they are clear, wounds can be assessed without removing the dressing.
