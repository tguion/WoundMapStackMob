<p>Patient information needs to be secure. WoundMap requires a user to sign in using a unique username and password. To protect patient privacy, you should sign out when finished using the app.</p>
<p><strong>iOS Security Features</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the WoundMap username/password, you can elect to use iOS security features. The most obvious iOS security feature is the iOS Pin Code that provides access to the device. Other security features are detailed in <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/security.html'>Apple's web site</a> at http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/security.html.</p>
<p>Note that you may elect to not enter the patient's name when adding a new patient. Use the <strong>EMR/Record Identifier</strong> to identify the patient.</p>
