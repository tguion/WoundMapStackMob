<p>The most intellegent part of the wound care documentation process is you, the clinician. By taking a photo of the patient, the patient's face will be centered in the compass view at all times. Matching the patient's face shown in the compass view to the patient helps you be sure you are collecting data for the intended patient record.</p>
<p><strong>Taking the Patient Photo</strong></p>
<p>From the home screen, tap the center of the compass view. An interface will be presented to take the patient photo. Be sure to have the patient's face in the photo. Facial recognition is used to center the patient's face in the center of the compass view.</p>
