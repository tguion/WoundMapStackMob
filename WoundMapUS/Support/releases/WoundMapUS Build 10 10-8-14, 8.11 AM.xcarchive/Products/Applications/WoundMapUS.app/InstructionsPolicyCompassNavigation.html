<p>The <strong>Policies</strong> adopted by your clinical institutions are reflected in the <strong>Compass Interface</strong>.</p>
<p>Policies determine when and in what order the wound care tasks need to be addressed. The Compass points to the next task that requires attention according to the policy for the currently selected <strong>Clinical Setting</strong> and <strong>Stage of Care</strong>.
<p>Some tasks, such as <strong>Photo</strong>, represent a set of subtasks. When such a task is tapped, the compass repopulates with the subtasks, and the aggregating task is shown in the center of the compass. When you are finished with the subtasks, tap the center of the compass, or tap the home button located at the top left of the screen.</p>
<p>The status of each task is marked with an icon. The green icon indicates that the task is up-to-date. The yellow icon indicates the task needs to be addressed soon. The red status icon indicates that the task is out of compliance with the policy.</p>
