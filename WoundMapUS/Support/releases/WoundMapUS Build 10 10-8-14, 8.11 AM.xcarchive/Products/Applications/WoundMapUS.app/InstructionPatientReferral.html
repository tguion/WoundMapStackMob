<p>Team members can refer a patient to another team member by creating a patient referral.</p>
<p>First select the patient using the 'Select Patient' button. Then tap the share button on the home view and select patient referral. Enter or dictate a note and select the referee - the other team member that you want to refer the patient to.</p>
<p>The referee will see an indication on the 'Select Patient' button that a referral has been created. The referee can then select the patient, and from the patient table tap the 'Referral' button to view the referral note.</p>
<p>The referee would typically edit the patient record, and then return to the referral, enter or dictate a note, and refer back to the originator of the referral, or refer the patient to another member of the team.</p>
<p>The notes made by each referee are recorded and displayed on the referral view.</p>
